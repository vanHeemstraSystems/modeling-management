# 100 - Introduction

We will be using Bricklink Studio (v2) to create virtual LEGO-like models which we can then use as virtual environments in a software such as Home Assistant to add interactivity (e.g., turning on/off lights) as a **Digital twin** of the real environment (e.g., data Center or Living Room).
